    <h1>Stories of different Links in the Legend of Zelda</h1>

    <h2><a href="#">Hero of Time(Ocarina of time, Majora's Mask, and Twilight Princess)</a></h2>
    <div>
      <p>When Link was a baby, there was a Hyrule Civil War. Link's father was killed and his mother, 
        nearing her death, goes into the lost woods and leaves Link in the care of the Great Deku Tree, 
        where he is raised as a Kokiri(a group of forest people who never age to adulthood). One day, 
        the Great Deku tree summons Link and tells him that a man named Ganondorf is trying to break in 
        to the Sacred realm to obtain the Triforce, and that the only way to stop him is by getting the 
        Triforce first. The Great Deku Tree gives Link the Kokiri Emerald, the first of 3 keys to the 
        Door of Time in the Temple of Time (the entry point to the Sacred Realm), before dying from the 
        poison Ganondorf left in him. Link sets of and collects the other two keys, being the Goron Ruby 
        from Darunia, becoming Sworn Brothers with him and the Zora Sapphire from Princess Ruto after 
        saving Lord Jabu Jabu and promising to marry her. On his way, Link meets Malon at the stable, 
        who introduces him to a pony Epona, and they become friends. Link, now having all 3 keys, makes 
        his way to Hyrule Castle, and sees Zelda and her guard Impa fleeing from the castle. Zelda throws 
        link the Ocarina of Time, the final piece needed to open the Sacred Realm, and shortly after, 
        Link sees Ganondorf chasing after them. Link goes to the Temple of time to go to the Sacred Realm. 
        As soon as Link touches the Master Sword, he is frozen in time, and he sees Ganondorf enter the 
        sacred realm and touch the Triforce. Because Ganondorf's intentions were not balanced, the 
        Triforce splits, giving Ganondorf the Triforce of Power, Zelda the Triforce of Wisdom, and Link 
        the Triforce of Courage. After seven Years, Link is freed from his slumber and wakes up, now 
        matured. he meets Sheik, who tells him how Ganondorf conquered Hyrule almost immediately when he 
        got the Triforce of Power, and that he needs to find the 6 sages to gain access to Ganondorf's 
        Castle. Link sets out and finds the Ancient Rauru, the Sage of Light, the Kokiri Saria, his 
        childhood friend, as the Sage of Forest, the Goron Darunia, now his True Brother, the Sage of 
        Fire, the Zora Ruto, now engaged to Link, the Sage of Water, the Sheikah Impa, the Sage of 
        Shadow, and the Gerudo Naburu, the Sage of Spirit. Link goes to the stable, and wins Epona from 
        a race before going to Ganondorf's Castle. Link fights his way to the top, and encounter's 
        Ganondorf, who discovered that Sheik was Zelda and captured her. Link fights Ganondorf, and 
        wins. Ganondorf, not willing to be the only one to lose, uses the Triforce of Power to bring the 
        Castle down on all 3 of them. Link and Zelda make a run for it and escape in time. Ganondorf, 
        now furious, uses the full power of the Triforce of Power and transforms into the monsterous 
        Ganon. Link fights him and plunges the Master Sword into Ganon's skull. Zelda then uses the 
        Ocarina of Time to send Link back before Ganondorf took the Triforce and he warns everyone, 
        using the Triforce of Courage as proof. Ganondorf is locked away awaiting his execution.</p>

        <p>Link, trying to deal with the trauma he experienced in his original timeline, sets out on a 
          quest to find Navi, his fairy companion throughout his previous adventure, and the only one 
          who was there in his original timeline, but gets jumped by a Skull Kid wearing the Majora's 
          Mask, who steals the Ocarina of Time. Link chases after him and Skull Kid turns Link into a 
          Deku kid and pushes him into the entrance to Termina, a pocket diminsion where the Skull Kid 
          will use the Majora's Mask to bring the moon down destroying it in 3 days. On the final day, 
          Link is able to confront Skull Kid and takes back the Ocarina of Time, using it to go back 3 
          days, beginning the time loop. On his first loop back, he meets the Happy mask Salesman, who 
          turns him back to his original form in exchange for returning the Majora's Mask to him. Link, 
          now with the ability to transform into the Deku form at will using the mask that was created, 
          sets out on his quest to awaken the 4 sleeping Giants to fight Skull Kid, gaining many masks 
          along the way and helping all the residents of Termina. He frees the first Giant by the Deku 
          Palace, then obtains the Goron Mask, left by the deceased Darmani to free the second Giant of 
          Snowhead Peaks. He then goes to Romani Ranch and finds Epona, able to ride her after saving 
          the ranch from THEM(basically aliens). He then encounters a dying zora in the water, who he 
          pushes to shore. Mikau, the dying zora, still dies, leaving behind the Zora Mask. Link frees 
          the Great Bay giant before going to the stone tower to free that giant. on the Dusk of the 
          Final Day, Link enters the clock tower to fight Skull Kid, calling the Giants to stop the Moon 
          from falling, when the Mask detaches from Skull Kid's face, discarding him like a used puppet. 
          The Mask enters the moon, and Link follows. In the Moon, Link is confronted with the 
          philosophical questions about identity that he himself was trying to understand through his 
          quest, trying to understand the trauma he is feeling before fighting Majora, defeating the evil 
          inside the mask. Link gives the mask to the Happy Mask Salesman who disappears, and leaves 
          Termina.</p>
        <p>The Hero of Time dies, likely in combat likely against Ganondorf(all future references of an 
          unspecified Link will be the Hero of Twilight, same with Zelda). As Ganondorf is being 
          Executed by the 6 sages, Ganondorf discovers that he has the Triforce of power. Ganondorf rips 
          the Sword of the Six Sages out of his chest and kills a Sage before being sucked into the 
          Mirror of Twilight. Because Ganondorf has a piece of the Triforce, he thrives, taking on the 
          appearance of a meteor and makes Zant into his puppet, granting him the power to usurp the 
          Twilight Throne. Zant, with his army, conquers Hyrule and imprisons Zelda. Link, a direct 
          descendant of the Hero of Time, gets jumped and is imprisoned in the Realm of Twilight, where 
          he takes the form of a Wolf. There, he meets Midna, the Twilight Princess, and they escape to 
          the light world. Midna convinces Link to help her obtain the rest of the Fused Shadow, a Relic 
          that will allow Midna to have enough power to defeat Zant. Over the course of his journey, 
          Link is trained by the Hero's Shade, the ghost of the Hero of Time in order to have the skills 
          to defeat Ganondorf. Link aids Midna in collecting the complete Fused Shadow and restoring 
          light to the regions. After collecting the final piece, Zant attacks Link and Midna, reverting 
          the region to Twilight and forcing Midna into the Light world, where she starts burning up and 
          dying. Link, stuck as a wolf, rushes Midna on his back to Hyrule Castle in hopes that Zelda 
          can save her. Link makes it to Zelda, and Zelda sacrifices her spirit to allow Midna to live 
          in the Light Realm. Link then seeks out the Master Sword and it allows him to transform at will. 
          Link and Midna then go to the Arbiter's Grounds to use the Mirror of Twilight to fight Zant, 
          but he breaks it and has hidden the pieces. Link and Midna find the pieces and fight Zant, 
          ending with Midna using the Fused Shadow to kill him. Link and Midna then make a run for 
          Hyrule Castle to fight Ganondorf, who has taken control of Zelda's body. Link beats them Midna 
          tends to Zelda. Ganondorf then transforms into the massive Beast Ganon, which Link defeats, 
          but Ganondorf is still active, so Midna returns Zelda's spirit to her and uses the Fused 
          Shadow to warp Link and Zelda out of the Castle so she can use the full power of the Fused 
          Shadow. Ganondorf rides out with his army, so Zelda creates the Light Arrows and Link gets 
          Epona and they ride, with Zelda shooting enemies and Link trying to get closer to Ganondorf. 
          Link and Zelda knock Ganondorf off his horse and Link fights Ganondorf in a duel, which Link 
          wins, killing him. With Ganondorf finally dead, the Hero of Time can finally rest.</p>

      <p>10,000 years ago, Ganon was defeated by using the 4 mechanical Divine Beasts, an army of 
        autonomous Guardians, an army of Sheikah warriors, as well as the Ancient Hero, weilding the 
        Master Sword and the Ancient Princess. It is prophesied that Ganon will return soon, so Link, a 
        soldier in Hyrule's Army, is chosen to be the wielder of the Master Sword. Link then becomes 
        Zelda's personal guard and they set out to select Champions for the recently resurfaced Divine 
        Beasts. They end up choosing Mipha, a Zora Princess who is known for her kindness and ability to 
        heal others, to pilot Vah Ruta, Daruk, a Goron leader who can create a shield out of nothing, to 
        pilot Vah Rudonia, Revali, a Rito archer, who is able to create updrafts at will, to pilot Vah 
        Medoh, and Urbosa, the Gerudo Queen and mother figure to Zelda, who has the ability to call 
        lightning down from the sky, to pilot Vah Naboris. Zelda then works on trying to awaken her 
        dormant powers to help seal away Ganon by praying at each of the Sacred Springs, but it doesn't 
        work. On their way back to the Castle from the Spring of Wisdom, Ganon attacks, turning all the 
        Guardians against Hyrule, seizing the Castle for himself. Link and Zelda aid in the war and the 
        4 Champions enter their Divine Beasts, where they encounter the Blight Ganons, entities created 
        by Ganon to beat the Champions. The Blights are Successful, killing all 4 Champions and 
        preventing the Divine Beasts from being used. During a battle on Necluda Grassland, Link and 
        Zelda are surrounded by Guardians. Link takes out a few of them before becoming mortally 
        wounded. Zelda, in a moment of great love and pain, awakens her powers and destroys all the 
        guardians in the area. Zelda then orders Link to be taken to the Shrine of Resurrection and 
        returns the Master Sword to the Lost Woods before going to Hyrule Castle to seal herself and 
        Ganon until Link returns. 100 years later, Link wakes up in the Shrine of Resurrection with no 
        memories. He gets the basic situation explained to him by the ghost of King Roam Bosphoramas 
        Hyrule and sets out on his quest to free the 4 Divine Beasts from the Blight Ganons. Link ends 
        up needing assistance getting to each Divine Beast, so Sidon, Mipha's younger brother, helps 
        Link get to Vah Ruta, Yunobo, a decendent of Daruk, helps Link get to Vah Rudonia, Teba, some 
        random Rito(Revali may not have had any decendants), helps Link get to Vah Medoh, and Riju, 
        decendent of Urbosa, helps Link get to Vah Naboris, freeing all the Champions Souls. Link then 
        reclaims the Master Sword and works to recover his memories before going to fight Ganon. The 4 
        champions ghosts' use the Divine Beasts to weaken Ganon, and Link defeats him. Ganon, fully 
        giving up on reincarnation, becomes the titanic Dark Beast Ganon who, with some well placed 
        Light Arrows, goes down, and Zelda finishes him off using the Triforce. After the battle, Link 
        and Zelda work together to rebuild Hyrule.</p>

        <p>While exploring some of the caves below Hyrule Castle, Link and Zelda discover the Mummified 
          corpse of Ganondorf being suspended by a floating arm. The arm falls away, and the corpse 
          falls limp before the head twists toward Zelda and the eyes snap open. Zelda picks up the 
          Secret Stone that was dropped before Ganondorf attacks with tentacle-like arms of Gloom. Link 
          blocks the attack with the Master Sword, but it shatters the blade and corrupts Link's arm. 
          Zelda gets knocked of the side of the cliff and dissapears. Link gets knocked out by ganon and 
          wakes up badly wounded on the Great Sky Island, one of many islands now in the sky due to the 
          Cloud Barrier, the shield preventing them from being seen or reached, was broken. Link, now 
          with King Rauru's arm, sets out to find Zelda and defeat Ganondorf. Before departing from the 
          Great Sky Island, Link has a vision of Zelda, explaining that she is in the past, and would 
          repair the Master sword, so he leaves the Master Sword's remains and goes to Lookout Landing 
          to find out what is going on around Hyrule and to find the Sages. Link solves the problems in 
          Zora's Domain, awakening Sidon as the Sage of Water, Goron Village, awwakening Yunobo as the 
          Sage of Fire, Rito Village, awakening Tulin, son of Teba, as the Sage of Wind, and Gerudo 
          Desert, awakening Rifu as the Sage of Lightning. Link also finds Mineru, the Sage of Spirit 
          from the past, and builds a mechanical body for her ad her instruction. Link, while exploring 
          Hyrule, finds small pools of water in the Ancient Geoglyphs, which reveal what Zelda had been 
          up to in the past. Zelda Woke up to see King Rauru and Queen Sonia, the first king and queen 
          of Hyrule, looking over her. Sonia detects that they are related, and Zelda explains the 
          situation. Sonia helps Zelda learn her time powers, explaining that the Secret Stones greatly 
          enhance the user's abilities, and Zelda uses them to retrieve the Master Sword from Link. 
          Ganondorf comes to the Castle and swears loyalty to Rauru, but due to Zelda's warning, they 
          are cautious to believe him. One day, Zelda and Sonia are talking when Ganondorf comes up 
          behing Sonia and kills her, stealing her Secret Stone. War begins and Rauru apoints sages to 
          help defeat Ganondorf. He selects an unnamed Zora, Goron, Rito, and Gerudo, as well as Mineru 
          and Zelda. During the fight, they realize that there is no way for them to defeat Ganondorf, 
          so Rauru grabs Ganondorf and puts both of them in a stasis beneath Hyrule Castle. Zelda 
          discovers that the only way to repair the Master Sword would be to bathe it in Light Essence, 
          and the only way to do that would be if Zelda underwent Draconification, the process caused by 
          consuming a Secret Stone that turns the consumer into a dragon. Zelda does so and waits as a 
          dragon until her original time comes. Link pulls the repaired Master Sword from her head and 
          goes to fight Ganondorf. Link defeats Ganondorf, but in one final move of desperation, 
          Ganondorf swallows his Secret Stone and becomes a dragon. The Light Dragon Zelda arrives and 
          allows Link to ride her to reach Ganondorf. Link kills Ganondorf and then Link trys to return 
          Zelda to her original form, which the ghosts of Rauru and Sonia help with, and Zelda becomes 
          Hylian again.</p>
