    <dt>Ocerina of Time</dt>
    <dd>The soundtrack to Ocerina of time features some of the most iconic pieces of 
      music in zelda, and the themes are often remixed in other games. these include Zelda's Lullaby, 
    Saria's Song, and Gerudo Valley. </dd>
    <dt>Breath of the Wild</dt>
    <dd>The soundtrack to Breath of the Wild is more subtle than a lot of the other game's soundtracks, 
      but it works really well because it is meant to be much calmer and draw you in more. Some of 
      my favorite songs are Kass's Theme, the Champion's Themes(Mipha, Daruk, Revali, and Urbosa), 
      and Korok Forest.
    </dd>
    <dt>A Link Between Worlds</dt>
    <dd>Part of this choice is because I just finished the game, but it remasters a lot of the soundtracks 
      used in other 2d Zelda games that bring a sense of adventure. Some of my favorites are Ravio's 
      theme, Hyrule Field, and Kakariko Village. 
    </dd>
    <dt>Honorable Mentions</dt>
    <dd>I wanted to include a few songs from games that didn't quite make the list, like Fi's Farewell 
    from Skyward Sword, Mipha's Lament from Twilight Princess, or the trailer theme for Tears of the 
    Kingdom</dd>
