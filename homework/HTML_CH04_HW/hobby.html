    <p>Unmatched is a board game that I play where you and the person/people you are playing with play as 
      a character from literature, film, shows, games, history, legends, etc. Each character, referred to 
      as a Hero, has their own unique deck, typically 30 cards + a character card. Each set has 1-2 boards, 
      but it is highly encouraged to mix and match everything. The actual gameplay revolves around defeating 
      your opponents. Most of the Heroes also have other fighters who assist them. These are called Sidekicks, 
      and they can have their own health or only have 1 health, but have multiple of them, typically 3-4. 
      All fighters also have a Character Ability, printed on their Character card. This is typically the 
      main gimmick of the deck, some examples being switching between increased attack or defense, placing 
      tokens on the board to damage opponents, or a revive mechanic. The ultimate goal is to defeat your 
      opponent. A link to all sets and fighters can be found <a href="list.html">HERE</a>

    <p style="color: coral;">As I was starting this assignment, they announced that they will rerelease Bruce Lee, a classic solo 
      fighter that is super expensive because of scalpers($200+), and pair him with Muhammad Ali, the #1 most wanted 
      deck by the head of Restoration Games(the company that makes the game).
