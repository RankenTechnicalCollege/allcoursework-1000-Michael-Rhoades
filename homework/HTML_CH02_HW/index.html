  <h2>Board Games</h2>
  <p>I enjoy playing board games. Some of my favorites are Isle of Cats and Unmatched. Isle of cats 
    is a strategy game where you try to pack as many cats on your board as possible. Unmatched is a 
  game where you play as a character from literature, movies, games, history, or legends in a fight 
  with another character. some of the characters include King Arthur, Nikola Tesla, Alice(from Alice in 
  Wonderland), Hamlet, and the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park. </p>
